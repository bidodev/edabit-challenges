/**
 * Create a function that takes a string as an argument. 
 * The function must return a string containing 1s and 0s based on the string argument's words. 
 * If any word in the argument is not equal to "zero" or "one" (case insensitive), you should ignore it. 
 * The returned string's length should be a multiple of 8, if the string is not a multiple of 8 you should remove the numbers in excess.
